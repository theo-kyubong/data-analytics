## Representative Analytical Projects
### Capstone Project (Data Analysis in Corporate Setting)
[* KB Life Insurance: Designing Customized Management Approaches for FC Channel Efficiency Enhancement (Business Insights, Clustering)](https://github.com/lee-kyubong/data-analytics/blob/master/KBL/KBL_summarizedreport.pdf)
- Acquiring insurance domain knowledge through interviews with key sales channel managers (FC, GA, TA)
- Variable creation from settlement management data for constructing analysis tables
- Selecting significant variables (indicators) through regression analysis and performing clustering based on them (using R)
- Sharing analysis results with operational practitioners and proposing management approaches tailored to each cluster's characteristics

### Data Mining
[* Clustering Subgroups of National Assembly Members based on Co-sponsored and Individual Bill Proposals (Unsupervised Learning, Clustering)](https://github.com/lee-kyubong/data-analytics/blob/master/Clustering_Politician-Party/Clustering(Political%20sub-parties).ipynb)
- Preprocessing to transform given bill proposal data (individual sponsorship, co-sponsorship, co-sponsor names, party affiliation of each member (anonymous)) into "distance data" between members
- Clustering using k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms (unsupervised learning)
- Adjusting and refining parameters based on comparison with the 2016 political situation

### EDA Visualization
[* Text Mining of PB & NB Snack Products in the Domestic Market (Correlation Coefficient, Frequency Analysis, Marketing)](https://github.com/lee-kyubong/data-analytics/blob/b45d9714df803aed7431dbca8767ca1b153c461e/EDA_SnackMarket/Korean_Snack_Market_Analysis.pdf)
- Crawling blog posts within Naver Open API service
- Text data preprocessing using R packages (tm, KoNLP)
- Identifying correlations among key keywords within the snack products using Graphical Lasso algorithm

### DB Marketing
[* RFM exercise (Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques, Variable Selection)](https://github.com/lee-kyubong/data-analytics/blob/master/RFM_exercise/report.pdf)
- Analyzing customer purchase data including Recency, Frequency, and Monetary variables / Predicting the likelihood of inducing purchases upon issuing coupons
